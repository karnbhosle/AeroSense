# Dataset Profile

This project uses a real-world Air Quality dataset covering the period from 2015 to 2024.
The dataset contains daily air pollution records for major Indian metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bangalore.

Each record contains measured values of major atmospheric pollutants along with the calculated Air Quality Index (AQI) and its corresponding health-based category.

The dataset provides sufficient historical data to train an accurate Machine Learning model for AQI prediction.
